        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
       <p>Hello! My name is Marin Grillo, and I am pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s Degree at Syracuse University in <strong>Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises.</strong> During my time in university, I have focused my studies on technological innovation and sales. I have held three internships over the past four years and gained experience in account management, product management, and business development. Outside of academics, I enjoy working on various startups, exploring fitness, and learning to cook! I am also very close with my friends and family and make sure to keep in touch despite distance and other obstacles.</p>
